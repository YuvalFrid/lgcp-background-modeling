# LGCP Background Modeling

This repository implements a Log Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) for modeling 1D probability distributions, with a focus on use cases in scientific data modeling and background estimation.

## 🔍 Highlights
- Bayesian, non-parametric approach to background estimation
- Implemented from scratch using NumPy and PyTorch
- Includes fitting, kernel construction, and evaluation
- Comparison with traditional methods like KDE and histograms

## 📁 Repo Structure

- `models/`: Core LGCP model implementation
- `utils/`: Utility scripts for kernels, plotting, metrics
- `notebooks/`: Interactive demo and exploration
- `results/`: Fit output and figures
- `data/`: Dummy or sample input files
